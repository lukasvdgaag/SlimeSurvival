# SlimeSurvival

SlimeSurvival is a new game inspired by a popular Minecraft server.

The game consists of two teams: slimes and survivors.
The slimes have to overpower the survivors by throwing slimes at them.
Survivors simply have to survive the slime attack by not getting slimed.

Once you're slimed, you either get frozen, turned into a slime as well, or die.

## More info about the game
Freeze mode means that overpowered survivors get frozen. They get put on a slime (as if they're riding it) and won't be able to move or get off the slime.
They can move once per x seconds (the slime will jump to the pointed direction).
Remaining survivors can revive the overpowered survivors by standing near them for x seconds, but have to be aware to not get slimed as well.

It's also possible to turn into a slime as well once you're overpowered.
You will then join the slime team and have to slime the remaining survivors.

If the slimes haven't overpowered all survivors in time, they will lose and the survivors will win the game.
But if the slimes manage to overpower all survivors in time, they will win and the survivors will lose the game.

During the game, there are several powerups that make surviving for survivors a little bit easier.
Things such as "Slime Trap", "Leap tool", "Invisibily wand" and more.

## A small description per game mode
### Normal Mode
Only one player is chosen to be a slime. The main slime has to slime survivors by throwing slimes at them. Once a survivor gets slimed, they turn into slimes as well and have to help the main slime.
  
### Classic Mode
One player gets chosen to be the slime. This player has to transfer their slime to another player in order to win. At the end of the game, the player who is the slime loses, the other survivors win.

### Freeze Mode
A few players are chosen to be slimes. They can paralyse players by throwing slimes at them, but survivors can rescue their paralysed teammates. If everyone gets paralysed, slimes win!

## Development
