# SlimeSurvival

SlimeSurvival is a new game inspired by a popular Minecraft server.

The game consists of two teams: slimes and survivors.
The slimes have to overpower the survivors by throwing slimes at them.
Survivors simply have to survive the slime attack by not getting slimed.

Once you're slimed, you either get freezed, turned into a slime as well, or die.

## More info about the game
Freeze mode means that overpowered survivors get freezed. They get put on a slime (as if they're riding it) and won't be able to move or get off the slime.
They can move once per x seconds (the slime will jump to the pointed direction).
Remaining survivors can revive the overpowered survivors by standing near them for x seconds, but have to be aware to not get slimed as well.

It's also possible to turn into a slime as well once you're overpowered.
You will then join the slime team and have to slime the remaining survivors.

If the slimes haven't overpowered all survivors in time, they will lose and the survivors will win the game.
But if the slimes manage to overpower all survivors in time, they will win and the survivors will lose the game.

During the game, there are several powerups that make surviving for survivors a little bit easier.
Things such as "Slime Trap", "Leap tool", "Invisibily wand" and more.

## Development
